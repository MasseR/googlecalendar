For a long time I've wanted to sync my Remind files with google calendar so
that they'd be propagated to my other devices. There exists a python script for
that, but it's unfunctional for me at the moment. This gave me the motivation
to try to interact with google calendar api with haskell. This gives me a
chance to hone my haskell.

There is no guarantee for ever finishing this.
